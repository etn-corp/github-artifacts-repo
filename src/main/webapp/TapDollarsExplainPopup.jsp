					Tap Dollars are the "all in" dollars for a selected account. This new dollar type tracks sales and orders for an account without regard to whether the account was loaded as the charge to, contractor, or market to customer on the order or invoice.  Each customer would only be counted once on any given transaction and is tracked using the customers listed on each transaction.
